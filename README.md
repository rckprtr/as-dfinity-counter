# Unofficial DFINITY AssemblyScript CDK

This is an experimental project to evaluate how AssemblyScript could be used as a CDK and should not be used for any production purposes.


To get started:

1. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.

1. Download the DFINITY Canister SDK, if needed:

    ```
    sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
    ```

1. Select a language—for example, `c` or `motoko`—to explore the examples available in the language of your choice.

1. Clone the repository to download the `examples` repo to your local workspace.

1. Open the project folder for the example you want to use.

1. Start a local internet computer replica by running the following command:

    ```
    dfx start
    ```

1. Open a new terminal shell on your local computer.

1. Build the sample project by running the following command:

    ```
    dfx build
    ```
